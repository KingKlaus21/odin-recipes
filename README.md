Website for Recipe

In this project I was able to showcase my HTML skills.  I used commands such as "em" and "em" to emphasize text, used "img" to put images of some delicious pastries, used "h1-h3" to express titles, "p" for paragraphs, "ul" and "ol" for lists, and other basic concepts such as linking to website pages and images.  I also made good use of the git commands.
