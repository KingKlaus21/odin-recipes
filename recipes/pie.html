            <li>1/4 cup cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <h3>For Egg Wash</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p></p>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the flour, salt, and sugar</li>
            <li>Add the cold, cubed butter and use a pastry cutter to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs</li>
            <li>Gradually add ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, and mix until the dough comes together</li>
            <li>Divide the dough in half, shape each into a disk, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 1 hour</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C).</li>
            <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll out one of the pie crust disks to fit a 9-inch pie dish.  Place it in the dish and trim any excess overhang</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, gently toss together the blueberries, sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, and cinnamon until the blueberries are well-coated</li>
            <li>Pour the blueberry mixture into the pie crust</li>
            <li>Roll out the second pie crust and place it over the blueberry filling.  Trim any excess overhang and crimp the edges to seal the pie</li>
            <li>Cut a few slits or create decorative patterns on the top crust to allow steam to escape during baking</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, whisk together the egg and water.  Brush the top crust with the egg wash for a golden finish</li>
            <li>Place the pie onto a baking sheet and bake for 45-50 minutes or until the crust is golden and the filling is bubbly</li>
            <li>Remove the pie from the oven, let it cool for 15 minutes, and serve</li>
        </ol>
