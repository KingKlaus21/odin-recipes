        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking poweder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Wet Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3/4 cup buttermilk</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease a donut pan.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients: flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the wet ingredients: buttermilk, eggs, melted butter, and vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix; it's okay if there are a few lumps.</li>
            <li>Spoon or pipe the batter into the prepared donut pan, filling each mold about 2/3 full.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into a donut comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Allow the donuts to cool in the pan for a few minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
            <li>Glaze or decorate with powdered sugar, chocolate, or your favorite toppings!</li>
        </ol>
