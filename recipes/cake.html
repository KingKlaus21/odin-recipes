        <h2>Description</h2>
        
        <p>
            The Odin Cake has been passed down from generation to generation, and now I pass it on to you.  The Odin Cake is a multi-layered chocolate cake of Godly 
            proportions, named after the Norse God himself <em>and totally not the Odin Project which is definitely not where it came from</em>.  
            The Odin Cake is guaranteed to change your life.  You will <strong>NEVER</strong> look at cake the same way ever again.  
            Its mighty flavor and heavenly layers of chocolate is something truly out of this world.  Now, let's get started.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
       
        <ul class="ulIndent">
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 3/4 cups granulated sugar</li>
            <li>3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 cup boiling water</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        
        <ol class="olIndent">
            <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine all the dry ingredients: flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Mix well.</li>
            <li>Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients: eggs, milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract. Beat on medium speed for about 2 minutes until the batter is smooth.</li>
            <li>Gradually add the boiling water to the batter, mixing on low speed. The batter will be thin, but that's okay.</li>
            <li>Pour the batter evenly into the prepared cake pans.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for about 10 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
            <li>Use a large knife to spread frosting along the sides and top of the cake.</li>
            <li>Decorate using sprinkles, chocolate, fruit, and other fun ingredients!</li>
        </ol>
