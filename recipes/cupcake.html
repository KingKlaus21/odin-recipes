        <h2>Description</h2>
    
        <p>
            The Odin Cupcake is only a tenth of the size of the Odin Cake, but its flavor is immeasurable.  This cupcake puts other cupcakes to shame, as its delicious 
            frosting and chocolate interior is powerful enough to put thirteen elephants into a sugary food coma.  Now, let's experience it for ourselves.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        
        <ul class="ulIndent">
            <li>1 all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>1/2 cup hot water</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        
        <ol class="olIndent">
            <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a muffin tin with cupcake liners.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream the softened butter and sugar together until light and fluffy, using a hand mixer or stand mixer.</li>
            <li>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Then, mix in the vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the sour cream, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. Mix until just combined.</li>
            <li>Slowly pour in the hot water while mixing on low speed until the batter is smooth. The batter will be thin, but that's normal.</li>
            <li>Divide the batter evenly among the cupcake liners, filling each about 2/3 full.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Remove the cupcakes from the oven and let them cool in the muffin tin for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
            <li>Wait until cool before frosting and decorating as you please.</li>
        </ol>
